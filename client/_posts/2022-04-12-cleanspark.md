Bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK) announced a deal with energy technology company Lancium to secure an initial 200 megawatts (MW) at Lancium’s renewable-powered West Texas datacenters, with an option for an additional 300MW in the future.

*CORRECTION (March 31, 15:35 UTC): Updated to properly reflect expected hashrate as of spring 2023.*

CleanSpark expects about 50MW of the purchased capacity to be operational by the end of this year, with the remaining 150MW to be fully online during spring 2023, the company said in a statement. At full deployment of the 200MW power capacity, the miner’s [hashrate](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/) is expected to be 10.4 exahash per second (EH/s), or more than double [previous guidance for](https://www.cleanspark.com/uploads/investor-relations/presentation/Q1_Investor_Presentation_Mar_2022.pdf) year-end 2022. At full deployment of the additional 300MW power capacity (no timeline given), CleanSpark's hashrate will be 16 EH/s.

In comparison, Core Scientific (CORZ), the largest publicly traded bitcoin miner by hashrate, expects its year-end [mining capacity to reach 40 EH/s-42 EH/s](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/29/bitcoin-miner-core-scientifics-full-year-sales-rise-to-545m-beating-estimates/). Meanwhile, Marathon Digital (MARA) sees its hashrate at approximately 23.3 EH/s by early 2023, and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) anticipates hitting [12.8 EH/s](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/16/riot-blockchain-sees-2022-as-year-of-consolidation-in-bitcoin-mining-sector/) by the end of 2022.

CleanSpark’s stock has been a sizable outperformer in 2022, gaining 30% versus declines of 22% for Core Scientific, 10% for Marathon and 1% for Riot.
“We continue to build more capacity at our own bitcoin mining facilities while we partner with colocation service providers,” said CleanSpark’s CEO Zach Bradford in the statement. “This hybrid approach helps us ensure that we always have rackspace ready to deploy new machines when they are delivered to us by the manufacturers,” he added.
